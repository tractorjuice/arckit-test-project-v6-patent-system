# UK Government Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) Assessment

**Project**: Patent Management System for the UK Intellectual Property Office
**Department/Agency**: UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO)
**Assessment Date**: 2025-10-15
**Assessor**: Enterprise Architecture Team
**Project Phase**: Requirements Complete (Pre-Alpha)
**Assessment Type**: Initial Assessment

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Compliance**: 105/130 points (81%)

**Status**: ✅ **GOOD - Compliant with minor gaps**

**Critical Issues**: 1 blocking issue
**High Priority Issues**: 2 issues requiring attention
**Recommendations**: 5 actionable recommendations

### Key Findings

The Patent Management System demonstrates **strong alignment** with UK Government Technology Code of Practice at the requirements stage. The project excels in cloud-first architecture, security by design, open standards adoption, and reuse of government platform services (GOV.UK Pay, Notify, Verify).

However, **3 areas require attention** before proceeding to Beta phase:
1. **CRITICAL**: Sustainability and carbon impact assessment not addressed (TCoP Point 12)
2. **HIGH**: Code publication strategy undefined (TCoP Point 3)
3. **MEDIUM**: GDS Service Standard assessment not yet scheduled (TCoP Point 13)

**Recommendation**: Address critical sustainability gap immediately. Project is otherwise well-positioned for Alpha phase with strong technology foundations.

### 11. Define Your Purchasing Strategy ✅ COMPLIANT

**Principle**: Your purchasing strategy must show you've considered commercial and technology aspects, and contractual limitations.

**Compliance Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evidence**:
- [x] Procurement strategy documented (Budget section, BC-004)
- [x] Digital Marketplace considered/used (G-Cloud framework - BC-004)
- [x] Commercial considerations documented (3-year TCO calculated)
- [x] Technology options analysis (cloud-first decision, AWS GovCloud UK)
- [x] Supplier lock-in risks assessed (open standards, API-first reduce lock-in)
- [x] SME participation encouraged (G-Cloud framework enables SME access)
- [x] Contract terms considered (GOV.UK services have standard SLAs)

**Procurement Approach**:
- **Route**: G-Cloud framework (Digital Marketplace)
- **Contract Value**: £7M capital expenditure, £1.7M annual operational
- **Contract Length**: 3-year initial contract (with option to extend)
- **Exit Strategy**: Open standards and API-first architecture enable vendor switching

**Commercial Considerations**:
| Factor | Analysis | Risk Mitigation |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Total Cost of Ownership | £12.1M over 3 years (£7M capital + £5.1M operational) | FinOps monitoring, cost optimization |
| Vendor lock-in | AWS cloud (medium risk) | Open standards, Terraform IaC enables multi-cloud |
| SME access | G-Cloud framework enables SME participation | Lot structure allows smaller contracts |
| ROI | £6M savings over 3 years (£2M/year - £1.7M/year) | Business case approved by HM Treasury |

**Technology Considerations**:
- [x] Build vs buy analysis: Build custom platform (reusing GDS services)
- [x] Open source alternatives evaluated (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch chosen over proprietary)
- [x] SaaS vs hosted vs on-premise: Cloud-native (AWS managed services) chosen
- [x] Interoperability requirements: Open standards (WIPO ST.96) ensure international compatibility

**Findings**:
- Clear procurement strategy via G-Cloud framework (compliant with government procurement rules)
- 3-year TCO calculated (£12.1M) with ROI demonstrated (£6M net savings)
- Vendor lock-in risk mitigated through open standards and Infrastructure-as-Code
- SME participation enabled through G-Cloud framework
- Exit strategy: Open standards and API-first architecture enable vendor switching if needed
- Budget approved by HM Treasury (business case submitted and approved)

**Gaps**:
- Detailed contract terms not yet negotiated (expected during procurement phase)
- Specific vendors not yet selected (procurement not yet started)
- Social Value Model application not mentioned (required for contracts >£5M)

**Requirements Mapping**:
- Budget section: £7M capital, £1.7M annual operational costs
- BC-004: Procurement via G-Cloud framework (Digital Marketplace)
- BR-002: £2M annual cost savings (ROI justification)
- Architecture Principle 1: Cloud-First → AWS GovCloud UK selected

**Remediation**:
- **Action**: Apply Social Value Model (required for contracts >£5M) during procurement
- **Owner**: Procurement Team + Tim Moss (SRO)
- **Due**: Before contract award (Q1 2026)
- **Risk if not addressed**: MEDIUM - Non-compliance with government procurement policy

**Score**: 8/10

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Alpha Phase - Q1 2026)

#### 1. Address Sustainability Gap (CRITICAL)

**Action**: Conduct carbon impact assessment and set carbon reduction targets

**Why**: TCoP Point 12 is currently non-compliant. Sustainability is mandatory for all UK government technology projects. Greening Government ICT Strategy requires carbon assessment and Net Zero alignment.

**How**:
1. Appoint Sustainability Lead or engage sustainability consultant
2. Use Cloud Carbon Footprint tool or similar to assess current architecture's carbon footprint
3. Set carbon reduction target (recommend: 30% reduction over 3 years)
4. Select AWS regions with renewable energy commitments (eu-west-2 London has renewable energy)
5. Include carbon metrics in FinOps dashboards
6. Apply sustainability weighting in Social Value Model for procurement
7. Document sustainability strategy in architecture principles

**Owner**: Infrastructure Team + Sustainability Lead (to be appointed)

**Due**: Before Alpha phase (Q1 2026)

**Expected Outcome**: TCoP Point 12 score increases from 4/10 to 8/10 (COMPLIANT)

---

#### 2. Define Code Publication Strategy (HIGH)

**Action**: Create public GitHub repository and define code publication plan

**Why**: TCoP Point 3 requires code publication for transparency and collaboration. Currently no strategy defined.

**How**:
1. Create GitHub organization: `github.com/intellectual-property-office`
2. Decide which code to publish (recommend: core application code, IaC, CI/CD)
3. Select open source license (MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended for government code)
4. Document security-sensitive code exemptions (if any)
5. Establish code publication process (review before public push)
6. Publish sample code or starter templates during Alpha phase

**Owner**: Dr. Emily Roberts (Enterprise Architect) + Development Team

**Due**: Before Beta launch (Q2 2026)

**Expected Outcome**: TCoP Point 3 score increases from 6/10 to 9/10 (COMPLIANT)

---

#### 3. Schedule GDS Service Standard Assessments (HIGH)

**Action**: Engage GDS to schedule Service Standard assessments for Alpha, Beta, and Live phases

**Why**: TCoP Point 13 requires Service Standard compliance. Public Beta cannot launch without GDS assessment.

**How**:
1. Contact GDS Service Assessment team: serviceassessments@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
2. Request assessment slots for:
   - Alpha assessment: February 2026 (before Alpha complete)
   - Beta assessment: September 2026 (before Public Beta launch)
   - Live assessment: December 2026 (before Production Go-Live)
3. Prepare assessment materials (service blueprint, user research, architecture)
4. Conduct internal readiness review before each assessment

**Owner**: Sarah Williams (Product Owner) + Sophie Martin (User Research Lead)

**Due**: Schedule by January 2026, conduct Alpha assessment by February 2026

**Expected Outcome**: TCoP Point 13 score increases from 7/10 to 9/10 (COMPLIANT)

---

### Actions Before Beta Launch (Q2 2026)

#### 4. Conduct User Research and Complete DPIA

**Action**: Conduct user research with 20+ examiners and 50+ applicants; complete Data Protection Impact Assessment

**Why**: Validate user needs (TCoP Point 1) and ensure GDPR compliance (TCoP Point 7)

**Owner**: Sophie Martin (User Research) + Laura Davies (DPO)

**Due**: Before Beta launch (Q2 2026)

---

#### 5. Obtain Cyber Essentials Plus and Schedule ITHC

**Action**: Commission Cyber Essentials Plus assessment and schedule ITHC penetration test

**Why**: Required for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data classification (TCoP Point 6)

**Owner**: Michael Brown (CISO)

**Due**: Before Beta launch (Q2 2026)

---
