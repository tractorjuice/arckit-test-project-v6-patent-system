## Executive Summary

This Wardley Map provides strategic guidance for the Â£7M Patent Management System procurement, mapping all system components across the evolution axis (Genesis â†’ Custom â†’ Product â†’ Commodity) to inform build vs buy decisions. The map reveals that **62% of functionality can be purchased or reused** (GOV.UK services, cloud infrastructure, commercial products via G-Cloud 14), while **38% requires custom development** (patent-specific workflows, ML classification, international integrations).

**Key Strategic Insights**:
- **Reuse GOV.UK Services** (Â£0.5M savings): Pay, Notify, Design System, Verify are mature commodities
- **Buy via G-Cloud 14** (Â£2.1M): OCR, chemical structure search, authentication, monitoring as products
- **Build Custom Components** (Â£4.4M): ML patent classification (0.35), semantic search (0.42), examination workflow (0.38), WIPO/EPO adapters (0.45)
- **Avoid Building Commodities**: AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka are all >0.85 evolution, no business case for custom alternatives

This strategy aligns with **Technology Code of Practice Point 3 (Reuse)**, **Point 4 (Open Standards)**, and **Point 5 (Cloud First)**, supporting the 81% TCoP compliance score.

## 2. Evolution Stages Reference

### Genesis (0.00-0.25): Uncharted

**Characteristics**: Uncertain, poorly understood, rapidly changing, rare, high failure rate, high cost

**Patent Management System Components**: None

**Rationale**: Even the most innovative components (ML patent classification, semantic search) have precedents in other domains (general ML classification, semantic search in other industries). No truly novel, uncharted technology required.

### Custom-Built (0.25-0.50): Differentiation

**Characteristics**: Unique to organization, competitive advantage, requires in-house expertise, rapidly evolving

**Patent Management System Components** (BUILD):

| Component | Evolution | Rationale | Build Justification |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Patent Classification (ML)** | 0.35 | Patent-specific ML model trained on 10M CPC/IPC classifications; no commercial alternative with 95% accuracy on patent data | Competitive advantage for IPO examination speed; domain-specific training data |
| **Legacy PMS Integration** | 0.35 | 40-year-old bespoke system with no APIs; batch-only interfaces; undocumented proprietary formats | No vendor has expertise in legacy IPO systems; must build custom adapters |
| **Examination Workflow** | 0.38 | IPO-specific examination rules (UK Patent Act 1977, PCT requirements); unique business process | UK patent law nuances not supported by off-the-shelf workflow tools |
| **Semantic Prior Art Search** | 0.42 | Patent-specific semantic search trained on patent language, claims, technical descriptions | Commercial search engines lack patent domain fine-tuning; critical for examination quality |
| **WIPO Integration (ST.96)** | 0.45 | Custom adapter for WIPO ST.96 XML exchange; IPO-specific data mappings | WIPO ST.96 is evolving standard; requires ongoing customization for UK requirements |
| **Application Intake** | 0.42 | IPO-specific form validation, fee calculation, filing date rules | UK Patent Rules 2007 nuances require custom logic |
| **IP5 Data Exchange** | 0.52 | International patent data exchange with USPTO, EPO, JPO, KIPO, CNIPA | Near product stage but still custom integration for each office |

**BUILD Investment**: Â£4.4M (63% of development budget)

### Product (0.50-0.75): Rental

**Characteristics**: Off-the-shelf with customization, multiple vendors, defined features, declining cost, established best practices

## 4. Build vs Buy Analysis

### 4.1 Decision Framework

**Decision Criteria** (aligned with Architecture Principles):

| Criterion | Weight | BUILD Indicator | BUY Indicator |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Evolution Stage** | 30% | Genesis/Custom (0.0-0.5) | Product/Commodity (0.5-1.0) |
| **Competitive Advantage** | 25% | Unique to IPO patent examination | Common across industries |
| **Domain Specificity** | 20% | Patent/UK law specific | Generic business function |
| **Vendor Availability** | 15% | No suitable G-Cloud vendors | Multiple G-Cloud options |
| **Total Cost of Ownership** | 10% | Custom build cheaper long-term | Product cheaper (licensing < dev) |

**Scoring**: Each component scored 0-100 on each criterion. Weighted score >60 = BUILD, <40 = BUY, 40-60 = BUY with customization.

### 4.2 BUILD Decisions (Custom Development)

| Component | Evolution | BUILD Score | Key Justification | Risks if BOUGHT |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Patent Classification (ML)** | 0.35 | 88 | Patent-specific training data (10M CPC/IPC classifications); 95% accuracy target unmet by commercial ML; competitive advantage for IPO examination speed | Commercial ML tools lack patent domain accuracy; vendor lock-in to inferior models; ongoing licensing costs (Â£200K/year) |
| **Legacy PMS Integration** | 0.35 | 92 | 40-year-old bespoke IPO system; no APIs; proprietary batch formats; no vendor has IPO legacy expertise | No vendors can integrate; critical path blocker if outsourced; IPO retains legacy system knowledge |
| **Examination Workflow** | 0.38 | 85 | UK Patent Act 1977 compliance; IPO-specific business rules; examiner productivity critical to BR-001 (18â†’12 months) | Off-the-shelf workflow tools don't support UK patent law nuances; customization costs exceed custom build |
| **Semantic Prior Art Search** | 0.42 | 82 | Patent language fine-tuning (claims, technical descriptions); semantic similarity for patent documents; quality differentiator for IPO | Commercial search lacks patent semantic accuracy; examiner effectiveness depends on search quality; vendor lock-in risk |
| **WIPO Integration (ST.96)** | 0.45 | 78 | WIPO ST.96 XML standard evolving; IPO-specific mappings for UK patent data; international obligations (PCT) | WIPO ST.96 wrappers immature; IPO must control international data exchange for sovereignty |
| **Application Intake** | 0.42 | 80 | UK Patent Rules 2007 validation; IPO fee structure; filing date determination (critical legal function) | Commercial intake forms don't support UK Patent Rules; legal risk if validation errors |
| **IP5 Data Exchange** | 0.52 | 72 | Bilateral integrations with 5 international patent offices (USPTO, EPO, JPO, KIPO, CNIPA); each office has unique APIs/formats | No single vendor integrates all IP5 offices; IPO must own international relationships |
| **Examiner Dashboard** | 0.38 | 83 | IPO examiner workflows (search, classification, objections, correspondence); GDS Service Standard UI/UX for internal users | Off-the-shelf dashboards don't match IPO examination process; examiner productivity critical (BR-001) |
| **Patent Filing Service** | 0.52 | 75 | IPO-specific filing rules (UK Patent Rules 2007, PCT national phase); integration with legacy PMS; GOV.UK Design System styling | Near product stage but UK-specific validation requires custom logic; cost effective to build on GOV.UK patterns |
| **Patent Search Service** | 0.48 | 78 | Public search interface for 3M published patents; semantic search integration; performance critical for public satisfaction (BR-004) | Commercial patent search UIs expensive (Â£300K+ licensing); IPO controls user experience |
| **Prior Art Search** | 0.42 | 80 | Patent examiner search combining semantic, keyword, classification, chemical structure; ML ranking of results by relevance | Commercial prior art tools (Orbit, PatBase) expensive (Â£500K/year); IPO retains search IP |
| **ML Classification Model** | 0.35 | 90 | Training on 10M IPO historical classifications (CPC/IPC); transfer learning from USPTO/EPO; domain-specific accuracy | Commercial ML platforms lack patent training data access; model IP valuable to IPO |

**Total BUILD Cost**: Â£6.44M (12 components)

**BUILD Strategy Risks**:
- **Delivery Risk**: Custom components on critical path; 18-month timeline tight for ML training + integration
- **Mitigation**: Agile sprints with MVP; ML model training in parallel with infrastructure setup; dedicated ML team (3 FTE)

### 4.3 BUY Decisions (G-Cloud 14 Procurement)

## 5. Inertia and Barriers to Movement

### 5.1 Inertia Analysis

**Inertia** = Resistance to moving a component along the evolution axis (e.g., modernizing legacy systems, adopting new technology)

| Component | Current Evolution | Desired Evolution | Inertia Level | Inertia Source | Impact on Project |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Legacy PMS** | 0.35 | 0.50 (modernize) | **Very High** | 40-year-old system; no APIs; batch-only; tribal knowledge; fear of data loss; examiner workflow dependency | **CRITICAL PATH RISK**: Legacy integration blocker (C-023, Â£620K); 6-month integration window; requires dedicated legacy team (2 FTE) |
| **Examiner Workflows** | 0.38 | 0.55 (standardize) | **High** | Examiner resistance to workflow changes; "we've always done it this way"; manual process comfort; training burden | **CHANGE MANAGEMENT**: 200 examiners need training; phased rollout required (alpha/beta per GDS); 3-month parallel running |
| **On-Premise Infrastructure** | 0.60 | 0.95 (cloud) | **Medium** | Existing data center; capital sunk cost; IT operations team skillset (on-prem); OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data sovereignty concerns | **PROCUREMENT DELAY**: Cloud security accreditation (2 months); BPSS clearance for AWS admins; data migration (3 months) |
| **Manual Patent Classification** | 0.30 | 0.60 (ML-assisted) | **High** | Examiner expertise ("ML can't understand patents"); CPC/IPC classification complexity; quality concerns; job security fears | **ADOPTION RISK**: Examiners may ignore ML suggestions; requires 95% accuracy to gain trust; 6-month pilot needed |
| **Paper-Based Processes** | 0.25 | 0.70 (digital) | **Medium** | 20% of applications still paper; scanning backlog (50K documents); legal signatures; original documents required by law | **SCOPE CREEP**: Paper digitization not in scope but impacts intake (C-006); OCR quality issues for handwritten notes |
| **WIPO ST.96 Adoption** | 0.45 | 0.65 (product) | **High** | WIPO ST.96 XML replacing ST.36; international patent offices at different adoption stages; UK must align with EPO timeline | **EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY**: EPO mandates ST.96 by 2026; IPO must comply; integration testing with WIPO delayed by pandemic |
| **Procurement Bureaucracy** | 0.50 | 0.80 (streamlined) | **High** | G-Cloud 14 call-off process; Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) approval gates; HMT Green Book business case; 6-month procurement cycle | **TIMELINE RISK**: 18-month delivery assumes vendor onboarded by Month 2; procurement delays push delivery to Month 20+ |

**Total Inertia Score**: 42/70 (60%) = **HIGH INERTIA ENVIRONMENT**

**Inertia Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Legacy PMS Integration**: Dedicate 2 FTE legacy specialists; 6-month parallel running; phased data migration (non-critical data first)
2. **Examiner Change Management**: GDS-style alpha/beta with 10 examiners; 3-month private beta with 50 examiners; training program (2 days per examiner)
3. **Cloud Security Accreditation**: Start ITHC (penetration testing) in Month 3; AWS GovCloud UK pre-accredited for OFFICIAL; expedite BPSS clearance
4. **ML Classification Trust**: 95% accuracy target (exceeds examiner average 92%); explainable AI (show similar patents); 6-month pilot with opt-out
5. **WIPO ST.96 Migration**: Implement ST.96 in parallel with ST.36; dual XML export; EPO integration testing in Month 9 (before EPO mandate)
6. **Procurement Acceleration**: Use G-Cloud 14 Direct Award (no competition needed if <Â£100K per component); aggregate procurement for oversight

### 5.2 Barriers to Evolution

By mapping GOV.UK services at 0.75-0.92 evolution (Product-Commodity), IPO justifies reusing Pay, Notify, Design System rather than building custom alternatives. This delivers Â£570K savings and accelerates delivery by 3-6 months (no custom development needed for payments/notifications).

### 7.3 Digital Marketplace (G-Cloud 14) Procurement Strategy

**G-Cloud 14 Context**: UK Government's framework for cloud services procurement; mandatory for central government departments (IPO is part of Department for Business and Trade)

**Wardley Map Procurement Guidance**:

| Evolution Stage | G-Cloud Procurement Approach | Wardley Map Components | Total Budget |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Genesis (0.00-0.25)** | DO NOT PROCURE via G-Cloud; build in-house R&D; no vendors available | None in this project | Â£0 |
| **Custom (0.25-0.50)** | BUILD in-house; no suitable G-Cloud vendors; IPO-specific requirements | Patent Classification (0.35), Legacy Integration (0.35), Examination Workflow (0.38), Semantic Search (0.42), WIPO Integration (0.45) | Â£6.44M (38% of budget) |
| **Product (0.50-0.75)** | BUY via G-Cloud 14 Direct Award (<Â£100K per service) or Further Competition (>Â£100K); multiple vendors available | OCR (0.72), Chemical Search (0.68), EPO Integration (0.68), Authentication (0.68), Publication (0.58), Renewal (0.55), RBAC (0.62), Data Warehouse (0.75), Event Streaming (0.72), API Gateway (0.82) | Â£2.06M (21% of budget) |
| **Commodity (0.75-1.00)** | USE AWS GovCloud UK (pre-approved); reuse GOV.UK services (free); commodity procurement | AWS services (0.85-0.95), GOV.UK Pay (0.90), GOV.UK Notify (0.92), GOV.UK Design System (0.75) | Â£1.12M (12% of budget) |

**G-Cloud 14 Direct Award Strategy** (for Product-stage components 0.50-0.75):

1. **OCR Engine (0.72, Â£240K)**: ABBYY FineReader Server listed on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award (no competition); negotiate volume pricing (50K applications/year)
2. **Chemical Structure Search (0.68, Â£320K)**: PerkinElmer ChemDraw or InfoChem ICM on G-Cloud 14; Further Competition (>Â£100K); technical evaluation (pattern matching accuracy, USPTO/EPO database integration)
3. **Authentication (0.68, Â£180K)**: Auth0 on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; OR use free GOV.UK Verify/One Login (decision based on MFA requirements)
4. **EPO Integration (0.68, Â£150K)**: Darts-ip or Minesoft wrappers on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; evaluate EPO OPS API coverage
5. **Publication Engine (0.58, Â£180K)**: Docmosis, Windward on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; template design services bundled
6. **Renewal Management (0.55, Â£150K)**: Chargebee on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; integrate with GOV.UK Pay
7. **Event Streaming (0.72, Â£220K)**: AWS MSK (Managed Kafka) on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; AWS GovCloud UK eligible
8. **Data Warehouse (0.75, Â£140K)**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; analytics instance sizing
9. **API Gateway (0.82, Â£120K)**: AWS API Gateway on G-Cloud 14; Direct Award; integrated with AWS services
10. **Authorization (0.62, Â£90K)**: Open Policy Agent (open-source, free); OR Casbin on G-Cloud 14; prefer OSS

**Total G-Cloud 14 Procurement**: Â£2.06M across 11 product-stage components

**Wardley Map Procurement Insight**: By classifying components at 0.50-0.75 evolution, IPO identifies which services have mature G-Cloud vendors. Custom components (0.25-0.50) are too unique for G-Cloud procurement; commodity components (0.75+) are utility services (AWS, GOV.UK). This strategic map guides procurement team on which RFPs to issue vs which services to direct-award.

### 8.2 Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Dependencies** (blockers if delayed):

| Dependency | Dependent Component | Blocker Component | Impact if Blocker Delayed | Mitigation |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Legacy Integration Required First** | Application Intake (0.42) | Legacy PMS Integration (0.35) | Filing service cannot save applications to legacy system; examiners have no access to new applications | **CRITICAL PATH**: Start legacy integration in Month 1; 6-month integration window; parallel running in Month 6-12 |
| **ML Model Training Before Classification** | Patent Classification (0.35) | ML Classification Model (0.35) | Classification service non-functional without trained model; examiners cannot use ML suggestions | **PARALLEL WORK**: Train ML model (Month 1-6) while building classification service (Month 3-9); model ready by service launch |
| **GOV.UK Pay for Payments** | Patent Filing Service (0.52), Renewal Management (0.55) | GOV.UK Pay (0.90) | Cannot accept filing fees/renewal payments; revenue loss; applications rejected | **LOW RISK**: GOV.UK Pay is free, mature service; integration 2-week effort; backup: Stripe on G-Cloud 14 |
| **Authentication Before Any Service** | All user-facing services (Filing 0.52, Dashboard 0.38, Portal 0.68) | Authentication (0.68) | No user login; security failure; cannot launch any service | **EARLY PRIORITY**: Implement Auth0/GOV.UK Verify in Month 2; all services depend on auth; 4-week integration |
| **AWS Infrastructure Before Apps** | All application services | AWS EKS (0.95), RDS (0.92), S3 (0.95) | No infrastructure to deploy applications; development blocked | **MONTH 1 PRIORITY**: Terraform IaC for AWS in Month 1; infrastructure ready by Month 2; CI/CD pipeline depends on this |
| **WIPO Integration for International Filing** | Application Intake (0.42), Patent Classification (0.35), Publication Engine (0.58) | WIPO Integration (0.45) | Cannot receive PCT applications; cannot export patents to WIPO; international obligations unmet | **MONTH 6 TARGET**: WIPO ST.96 integration by Month 6; PCT applications 30% of intake; critical for BR-003 (international integration) |
| **GOV.UK Design System for UI** | Public Portal (0.68), Patent Filing Service (0.52) | GOV.UK Design System (0.75) | UI doesn't meet GDS standards; fails accessibility; GDS Service Assessment failure | **NO RISK**: Design System is free, reusable; frontend developers trained on GDS patterns; 1-week integration |

**Critical Path Timeline** (18-month delivery):

```
Month 1: AWS infrastructure (Terraform IaC) + Legacy PMS integration starts
  â†“
Month 2: Authentication (Auth0/GOV.UK Verify) + Application runtime (EKS) ready
  â†“
Month 3: Application Intake development + ML model training (parallel)
  â†“
Month 4: OCR integration + Document storage (S3)
  â†“
Month 5: Patent Classification service (depends on ML model Month 6)
  â†“
Month 6: WIPO Integration (ST.96) + ML model trained + Legacy integration complete + ALPHA LAUNCH
  â†“
Month 7: Examiner Dashboard development
  â†“
Month 8: Prior Art Search + Semantic Search Engine
  â†“
Month 9: EPO Integration (OPS API) + Chemical Structure Search (PerkinElmer)
  â†“
Month 10: Examination Workflow + Publication Engine
  â†“
Month 11: Renewal Management + GOV.UK Pay integration
  â†“
Month 12: PRIVATE BETA LAUNCH (50 examiners)
  â†“
Month 13: Public Portal development + Patent Search Service
  â†“
Month 14: API Gateway + CDN (CloudFront) for public access
  â†“
Month 15: PUBLIC BETA LAUNCH + GDS Service Assessment
  â†“
Month 16: GDS feedback addressed
  â†“
Month 17: Load testing, security ITHC, final bug fixes
  â†“
Month 18: LIVE LAUNCH + Legacy PMS decommissioning plan
```

**Critical Path Risks**:
- **Legacy Integration Overruns**: 40% of IT projects with legacy integration exceed timeline; mitigated by dedicated team (2 FTE) and 6-month buffer
- **ML Model Accuracy <95%**: ML training may not hit 95% accuracy target; mitigated by transfer learning from USPTO/EPO models and manual fallback
- **WIPO ST.96 Delays**: International standards coordination delays; mitigated by dual ST.36/ST.96 support and EPO liaison
- **GDS Service Assessment Failure**: Service may not pass GDS assessment; mitigated by using GOV.UK Design System and early accessibility audits

## 13. Conclusion

### 13.1 Strategic Summary

This Wardley Map provides a **strategic procurement framework** for the UK IPO Patent Management System, classifying 37 components across the evolution axis (Genesis â†’ Custom â†’ Product â†’ Commodity) to inform build vs buy vs reuse decisions:

- **BUILD (38%, Â£6.44M)**: 12 custom components (0.25-0.50 evolution) where IPO has competitive advantage: ML patent classification (0.35), semantic search (0.42), examination workflow (0.38), WIPO/EPO integrations (0.45-0.68)
- **BUY (21%, Â£2.06M)**: 11 product-stage components (0.50-0.75) via G-Cloud 14: OCR (0.72), chemical search (0.68), authentication (0.68), publication/renewal tools (0.55-0.58)
- **REUSE (0%, Â£0 / Â£570K savings)**: 4 GOV.UK services (0.75-0.92) that are free: GOV.UK Pay (0.90), Notify (0.92), Design System (0.75), Verify (0.68)
- **COMMODITY (12%, Â£1.12M)**: 10 AWS managed services (0.85-0.95): EKS, RDS, S3, Redis, OpenSearch, CloudWatch

**Total Savings vs All-Custom Build**: Â£4.92M (Â£570K reuse + Â£1.2M buy vs build + Â£3.15M commodity cloud vs on-premise)

**Strategic Alignment**:
- **Technology Code of Practice (TCoP)**: 81% compliance; Point 8 (Reuse) and Point 11 (Purchasing Strategy) directly addressed by this Wardley Map
- **GDS Service Standard**: Point 13 ("Use common platforms") drives reuse of GOV.UK Pay/Notify/Design System; Point 11 ("Choose right tools") informed by evolution-based classification
- **G-Cloud 14 Procurement**: Product-stage components (0.50-0.75) procured via G-Cloud Direct Award; custom components (0.25-0.50) built in-house; commodity (0.75+) via AWS utility services

### 13.2 Key Strategic Insights

1. **62% of functionality can be purchased or reused** (GOV.UK services, G-Cloud products, AWS managed services), focusing IPO's Â£6.44M custom build investment on truly differentiated patent-specific capabilities (ML classification, semantic search, examination workflow).

2. **GOV.UK services deliver Â£570K savings** by reusing mature government platforms (Pay, Notify, Design System) rather than building custom alternativesâ€”a direct application of TCoP Point 8 (Reuse).

3. **ML patent classification (0.35 Custom) provides 3-year competitive advantage** before likely commoditization by vendors (Clarivate, PatSnap); IPO should plan to license/sell ML model to recoup Â£980K investment and generate Â£500K/year revenue.

4. **Legacy PMS integration (0.35 Custom) is critical path risk** requiring dedicated team (2 FTE), 6-month integration window, and parallel running; no vendor has expertise in 40-year-old IPO systems, justifying Â£620K custom build.

5. **Strategic evolution monitoring required**: ML classification (0.35) and semantic search (0.42) may evolve to Product stage (0.65+) by 2028, enabling migration to commercial products and Â£400K+/year maintenance savings.

### 13.3 Next Steps for Procurement

1. **Issue RFP with this Wardley Map**: Include procurement strategy map in Statement of Work (SOW) Section 4 to guide vendors on which components to bid for (BUY category only, not BUILD/REUSE)

2. **Evaluate vendor proposals against evolution stages**: Vendors proposing to build commodity components (e.g., custom payment gateway instead of GOV.UK Pay) should be questioned on strategic rationale and value for money

3. **Update Wardley Map quarterly**: Track component evolution during 18-month delivery; adjust build/buy decisions as technology matures; monitor vendor ML/semantic search products for commoditization

4. **Use map for change control**: If scope changes arise (e.g., new requirements), classify new components by evolution stage to determine build/buy/reuse strategy and cost impact

5. **Share with evaluation committee**: All evaluators (Enterprise Architect, CISO, Product Owner) should reference this Wardley Map when scoring vendor proposals to ensure strategic alignment
