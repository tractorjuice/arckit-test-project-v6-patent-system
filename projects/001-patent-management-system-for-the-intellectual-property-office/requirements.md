## Executive Summary

### Business Context

The UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) is the official government body responsible for intellectual property rights in the United Kingdom. The current patent management infrastructure relies on legacy systems developed over the past 20+ years, resulting in fragmented workflows, manual processes, and limited integration with international patent offices.

This Patent Management System (PMS) modernization initiative aims to transform patent application processing, examination, publication, and lifecycle management through a cloud-native, API-first platform. The system must handle the complete patent lifecycle from initial filing through grant, renewal, opposition, and eventual expiry, while maintaining compliance with UK patent law, international treaties (PCT, EPC), and UK Government technology standards.

The modernization directly supports the UK's commitment to innovation, economic growth, and international collaboration in intellectual property protection. By improving processing efficiency, reducing examination backlogs, and enhancing public access to patent information, the IPO can better serve inventors, businesses, and the broader innovation ecosystem.

### Objectives

- **Modernize Patent Workflows**: Replace legacy systems with cloud-native platform reducing patent examination time by 30%
- **International Integration**: Seamless data exchange with WIPO, EPO, and IP5 offices using international standards (WIPO ST.96)
- **Public Service Excellence**: Provide 24/7 public patent search, filing, and status tracking with 99.95% availability
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Full compliance with UK Government Technology Code of Practice, GDPR, and accessibility standards
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce operational costs by £2M annually through automation and cloud optimization

### Expected Outcomes

- **Processing Time Reduction**: Average time to first office action reduced from 18 months to 12 months (33% improvement)
- **Cost Savings**: £2M annual operational cost reduction through cloud efficiency and automation
- **User Satisfaction**: Achieve 85%+ satisfaction score from patent applicants and examiners
- **Backlog Reduction**: Reduce examination backlog from 15,000 to 5,000 applications within 24 months
- **Digital Adoption**: 90% of patent applications filed electronically (up from 65%)
- **International Competitiveness**: Match or exceed processing times of EPO and USPTO

### Project Scope

**In Scope**:
- Patent application intake (all filing routes: direct UK, PCT national phase, priority claims)
- Automated classification (CPC/IPC) with ML-assisted assignment
- Prior art search platform (UK, international, and non-patent literature)
- Examiner workflow and case management
- Applicant prosecution and correspondence management
- Publication system (18-month publication, grant publication)
- Grant and refusal decision processing
- Renewal fee management and legal status tracking
- Opposition proceedings workflow
- Public patent search portal and open data APIs
- Integration with WIPO, EPO, and IP5 offices
- Historical patent digitization and OCR processing
- Applicant self-service portal

**Out of Scope**:
- Trade mark management (separate system)
- Design rights management (separate system)
- Copyright registration (not registered in UK)
- Patent attorney licensing and regulation
- Fee payment infrastructure (will integrate with GOV.UK Pay)
- Email/SMS notifications (will integrate with GOV.UK Notify)
