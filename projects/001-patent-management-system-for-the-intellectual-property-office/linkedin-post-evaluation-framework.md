# LinkedIn Post: Vendor Evaluation Framework for Patent Management System

---

## Post Content

📋 **How do you evaluate vendors for a £7M government digital transformation project?**

We just completed the vendor evaluation framework for the UK Intellectual Property Office's Patent Management System modernization—and it's a masterclass in rigorous, fair procurement.

Here's what makes this evaluation process different:

🔍 **28 Mandatory Qualifications (Pass/Fail)**
Before any scoring begins, vendors must meet ALL requirements:
→ G-Cloud 14 Framework listing
→ Cyber Essentials Plus & ISO 27001
→ OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE project experience
→ WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility track record
→ Security clearance commitments (BPSS, SC)

No negotiation. No exceptions.

⚖️ **60% Technical / 40% Cost Split**
Why not 50/50? Because for a mission-critical patent system handling OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data:
→ Technical capability matters MORE than price
→ Security risks outweigh cost savings
→ Poor technical execution = project failure

Cost proposals are opened ONLY for shortlisted vendors—ensuring truly blind technical evaluation.

🎯 **4 Technical Categories (60 points total)**
1. Technical Approach (25 pts) - Architecture, security, integrations
2. Delivery Methodology (10 pts) - Agile, GDS alignment, DevSecOps
3. Team Qualifications (15 pts) - 10 key roles assessed individually
4. Experience & References (10 pts) - Government track record

Minimum threshold: 70% technical score to even be considered.

🎤 **Vendor Presentations with ±10% Adjustment**
Top 3-5 vendors present to the evaluation committee. Strong clarifications can boost scores; red flags can lower them. This ensures the paper proposal matches reality.

📞 **Comprehensive Reference Checks**
12-question template covering:
→ On-time & on-budget delivery
→ Team effectiveness
→ Issue resolution
→ "Would you hire them again?"

Multiple negative references = instant disqualification.

📊 **Complete Audit Trail**
Every score, justification, and decision documented for:
→ FOI (Freedom of Information) compliance
→ Appeals process (if needed)
→ 7-year government retention requirement

---

**Key Lessons for Procurement Leaders:**

✅ Mandatory qualifications eliminate unqualified bidders early
✅ Blind cost evaluation prevents price bias in technical scoring
✅ Consensus scoring (not averaging) produces better decisions
✅ Presentations validate paper proposals and surface risks
✅ Reference checks are non-negotiable—they reveal truth

This framework applies to ANY complex government technology procurement: benefits systems, healthcare platforms, tax systems, citizen services.

**What's your biggest vendor evaluation challenge?**

For me, it's always balancing "best value" with "lowest risk"—especially when innovative newcomers bid against established players. The 60/40 technical/cost split helps, but presentations and references are where you really learn who can deliver.

**Project Context:**
The IPO Patent Management System will modernize patent examination for 50,000 applications/year, integrate with WIPO and EPO, and provide public API access to patent data. 18-month delivery, cloud-native, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE security, WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility.

📋 **What does world-class vendor evaluation look like?**

Just completed the framework for a £7M UK Government patent system. Here's the approach:

**28 mandatory qualifications** (pass/fail before scoring)
**60% technical / 40% cost** (capability > price for critical systems)
**Blind evaluation** (cost opened only for shortlisted vendors)
**Vendor presentations** (±10% score adjustment)
**Reference checks** (12 questions, negative refs = disqualification)

Key innovation: Technical threshold of 70% to qualify for shortlist. Low-cost bidders who can't deliver never make it through.

Result: Rigorous, fair, auditable process that selects capability over cheapness.

📊 **The Anatomy of a £7M Government Vendor Evaluation**

[Infographic would show: Flow from 28 Mandatory Quals → Technical Scoring 60% → Cost Scoring 40% → Presentations ±10% → References → Award]

How the UK IPO evaluates vendors for their Patent Management System:

**Stage 1: Mandatory Qualifications (28 items)**
Fail any = Disqualified
→ G-Cloud listing, Cyber Essentials Plus, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE experience

**Stage 2: Blind Technical Scoring (60 points)**
→ Architecture (25), Delivery (10), Team (15), Experience (10)
→ Minimum 70% required to proceed

**Stage 3: Cost Evaluation (40 points)**
→ Only opened for shortlisted vendors
→ Lowest price wins 40 points, others scaled proportionally

**Stage 4: Presentations & References**
→ Top 3-5 vendors present
→ Scores adjusted ±10% based on performance
→ Reference checks validate claims

**Stage 5: Award**
→ Highest combined score (Technical 60% + Cost 40%)
→ Subject to reference checks and executive approval

**Total Timeline: 6 weeks from proposal receipt to award**

This isn't just procurement—it's risk management at scale.

When you're handling OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data, 50K applications/year, and public trust, you can't afford to get vendor selection wrong.

**Question for procurement leaders:**
Do you open cost proposals before or after technical evaluation? Why?

(I'm a strong believer in blind technical scoring—but I know it's controversial!)

🏛️ **Why Government Vendor Evaluation is Different**

Working on the UK IPO Patent Management System evaluation framework reminded me why public sector procurement is a different beast:

**Challenges unique to government:**

❌ Can't just pick the vendor you "know and trust"
→ Transparent, defensible process required (FOI compliance)

❌ Can't prioritize speed over fairness
→ Every vendor gets equal evaluation rigor

❌ Can't ignore accessibility
→ WCAG 2.2 Level AA is LAW (not nice-to-have)

❌ Can't compromise on security
→ OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE = Cyber Essentials Plus minimum, SC clearance required

❌ Can't accept "proprietary" without scrutiny
→ Open standards preferred, vendor lock-in is a risk

**But here's what government does BETTER:**

✅ Rigorous mandatory qualifications (28 pass/fail criteria)
✅ Blind cost evaluation (technical scored first)
✅ Structured reference checks (not just "who do you know?")
✅ Complete audit trail (7-year documentation retention)
✅ Appeals process (vendors can challenge unfair decisions)

**The Result?**

Slower? Yes (6 weeks vs. private sector's 2 weeks).
More expensive? Maybe (evaluation committee time).
Better outcomes? Absolutely.

When you're spending £7M of taxpayer money on a system handling 50K patent applications/year, you can't afford to get it wrong.

**Private sector procurement leaders:**
What could you learn from government's rigor?

**Public sector leaders:**
What could you learn from private sector's speed?

🏗️ **How to Evaluate Technical Architecture in Vendor Proposals**

The IPO Patent Management System RFP asks for a £7M cloud-native system. How do we score architecture quality objectively?

Here's our 25-point Technical Approach rubric:

**Architecture Quality (8 points)**
→ Cloud-native design patterns
→ Microservices aligned with patent workflows
→ Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)
→ Alignment with 21 enterprise architecture principles

**Technology Stack (6 points)**
→ Approved: Java/Python/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Kafka, EKS
→ Patent-specific: OCR (98% accuracy), ML classification, semantic search
→ Justification if exceptions requested

**Security Architecture (6 points)**
→ OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE controls (MFA, AES-256, TLS 1.3)
→ STRIDE threat model with mitigations
→ ITHC readiness (penetration testing)
→ UK data residency guaranteed

**Integration Strategy (3 points)**
→ WIPO ST.96 XML compliance
→ EPO OPS REST API integration
→ GOV.UK services (Verify, Pay, Notify)
→ Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries)

**Accessibility (2 points)**
→ WCAG 2.2 Level AA (not just automated testing)
→ GOV.UK Design System usage
→ Manual testing with disabled users

**The Secret Sauce?**

We score based on C4 diagrams, ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and threat models—not marketing fluff.

If your proposal says "scalable" without showing auto-scaling triggers, you lose points.
If you claim "secure" without a threat model, you lose points.
If you say "accessible" without a testing strategy, you lose points.

**Evidence > Claims**

**For Architecture Reviewers:**
What's your #1 red flag in vendor proposals?

Mine: "We use best practices" without specifics. Show me the patterns, the trade-offs, the ADRs.

💬 **Quick Poll: What's More Important in Vendor Selection?**

Evaluating vendors for a £7M government patent system. The debate in our committee:

A) **Technical Capability** (architecture, security, team skill)
B) **Delivery Track Record** (references, on-time/budget history)
C) **Cost** (lowest price wins)
D) **Cultural Fit** (communication, collaboration, government experience)

**Our weighting:**
60% Technical, 16% Track Record, 40% Cost, 0% Cultural Fit (assessed but not scored)

**The Controversial Take:**

We weighted technical 60% because:
→ Bad architecture can't be fixed with a good team
→ Security failures are catastrophic for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data
→ Accessibility lawsuits cost more than paying extra upfront

But some argue track record should be 40%+:
→ Past performance predicts future results
→ References reveal vendor's true nature
→ On-time/budget delivery matters more than perfect tech

**What would YOU prioritize?**
