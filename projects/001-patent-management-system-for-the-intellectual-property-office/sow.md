## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

The UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) seeks a qualified supplier to design, develop, and deliver a modern Patent Management System (PMS) that will transform how the UK manages patent applications from initial filing through to grant, maintenance, and eventual expiry.

The current patent infrastructure relies on legacy systems developed over 20+ years, resulting in fragmented workflows, processing delays, and limited integration with international patent offices. This modernization initiative will replace these systems with a cloud-native, API-first platform that delivers:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce average time to first office action from 18 months to 12 months
- **Cost Savings**: Achieve £2M annual operational savings through cloud optimization and automation
- **International Integration**: Seamless data exchange with WIPO, EPO, and IP5 offices using WIPO ST.96 standards
- **Public Service Excellence**: 99.95% availability for public-facing services with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Full compliance with UK Government Technology Code of Practice, GDPR, and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE security classification

### Business Context

The IPO is the official government body responsible for intellectual property rights in the United Kingdom, processing approximately 50,000 patent applications annually. The modernization directly supports the UK's commitment to innovation, economic growth, and international collaboration in intellectual property protection.

By improving processing efficiency, reducing examination backlogs from 15,000 to 5,000 applications, and enhancing public access to patent information, the IPO will better serve inventors, businesses, and the broader innovation ecosystem.

### Contract Value and Duration

- **Total Contract Value**: £7,000,000 (inclusive of all costs)
- **Contract Duration**: 18 months (from contract signature to go-live)
- **Implementation Timeline**: 14 months development + 4 months transition/stabilization
- **Warranty Period**: 90 days post-go-live (defect remediation at no additional cost)
- **Optional Support Period**: 24 months post-implementation support (priced separately)

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

### 6.1 Evaluation Methodology

Proposals will be evaluated using a **60% Technical / 40% Cost** weighted scoring model.

**Stage 1: Compliance Check**
- Verify all mandatory qualifications met
- Verify proposal format and completeness
- Non-compliant proposals will be disqualified

**Stage 2: Technical Evaluation (60 points)**
- Technical Approach: 25 points
- Delivery Methodology: 10 points
- Team Capability: 15 points
- Experience and References: 10 points

**Stage 3: Cost Evaluation (40 points)**
- Lowest compliant bid = 40 points
- Other bids scored proportionally: (Lowest Price / Bid Price) × 40

**Stage 4: Shortlist Presentations**
- Top 3-5 scoring bidders invited for presentations (2-hour session)
- Presentations may adjust technical scores by ±10%

**Stage 5: Contract Award**
- Highest combined score (Technical + Cost) wins contract
- IPO reserves right to negotiate with top-ranked supplier

### 6.2 Technical Scoring Criteria

#### 6.2.1 Technical Approach (25 points)

| Criterion | Points | Evaluation Focus |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Solution Architecture** | 8 | Cloud-native design, microservices appropriateness, technology choices aligned with IPO standards, scalability and resilience |
| **Security Architecture** | 6 | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE controls, threat model, encryption, audit logging, ITHC readiness |
| **Integration Strategy** | 4 | WIPO ST.96 compliance, EPO OPS integration, GOV.UK services integration, resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) |
| **Data Migration & Digitization** | 3 | Historical patent OCR approach, data migration with zero data loss, data quality assurance |
| **Accessibility** | 2 | WCAG 2.2 Level AA approach, automated testing, manual audits, user research with disabled users |
| **Innovation** | 2 | ML/AI for classification and search, novel approaches to patent examination efficiency, open-source contributions |

#### 6.2.2 Delivery Methodology (10 points)

| Criterion | Points | Evaluation Focus |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Agile Practices** | 3 | Sprint structure, user stories, continuous delivery, alignment with GDS Service Manual |
| **Quality Assurance** | 3 | Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E), CI/CD security gates, automated accessibility testing |
| **DevSecOps Maturity** | 2 | Infrastructure-as-Code, secrets management, SAST/DAST in CI/CD, DORA metrics tracking |
| **Risk Management** | 2 | Risk identification, mitigation strategies, contingency planning |

#### 6.2.3 Team Capability (15 points)

| Criterion | Points | Evaluation Focus |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Team Structure** | 3 | Roles coverage, reporting lines, escalation procedures, co-location/remote balance |

| **Knowledge Transfer** | 2 | Training approach, documentation, technical handover, sustainability |
| **Team Availability** | 2 | FTE commitment, UK-based team, security clearance timelines |

#### 6.2.4 Experience and References (10 points)

| **Relevant Case Studies** | 6 | Similarity to IPO project (government, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, patent/legal domain, scale), outcomes achieved |
| **Reference Quality** | 4 | Contactable references from UK government, positive feedback on delivery, security, accessibility |

### 6.3 Cost Scoring

**Total Contract Value** must include:
- All development, testing, and deployment costs
- Architecture and design effort
- Security compliance (ITHC, Cyber Essentials Plus)
- Data migration and OCR digitization
- Training and knowledge transfer
- Project management
- Travel and expenses
- Contingency

**Excluded from Total Contract Value** (priced separately):
- Optional 24-month support period (day rates for L1, L2, L3 support)

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Cost Score = (Lowest Bid Price / Supplier Bid Price) × 40 points
```

**Example**:
- Supplier A bids £7,000,000  Cost Score = (7M / 7M) × 40 = 40 points
- Supplier B bids £8,500,000  Cost Score = (7M / 8.5M) × 40 = 32.94 points
- Supplier C bids £6,500,000  Cost Score = (6.5M / 6.5M) × 40 = 40 points (new lowest)

### 6.4 Award Decision

**Combined Score** = Technical Score (60 points max) + Cost Score (40 points max)

The supplier with the **highest combined score** will be awarded the contract, subject to:
- Successful reference checks
- Financial due diligence
- Security clearance initiation for key personnel
- Negotiation of final contract terms (if required)

IPO reserves the right to:
- Award to the second-ranked supplier if top-ranked supplier fails reference checks or due diligence
- Cancel the procurement if no suitable suppliers meet requirements
- Negotiate with top-ranked supplier to optimize value for money
