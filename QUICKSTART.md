```bash
claude
```

### 5. Run Test Commands

Follow the test plan in `TEST-PLAN.md`:

```bash
# Phase 1: Architecture Principles
/arckit.principles Create architecture principles for UK Government DWP focused on cloud-first, security-by-design, accessibility WCAG 2.2 AA, and AI responsible deployment

# Phase 2: Requirements
/arckit.requirements Build a benefits eligibility chatbot for DWP that uses GPT-4 to answer citizen questions about Universal Credit, Job Seekers Allowance, and disability benefits. Must handle 10,000 concurrent users, comply with UK GDPR, WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility, integrate with existing DWP systems, provide accurate eligibility guidance, support English and Welsh languages, and include human-in-the-loop review before advice is shown to citizens.

# Phase 2b: Wardley Mapping
/arckit.wardley Create procurement strategy Wardley Map for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot showing build vs buy decisions

# Phase 2c: Architecture Diagrams
/arckit.diagram context Generate C4 context diagram for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot
/arckit.diagram dataflow Generate data flow diagram showing UK GDPR PII handling for benefits chatbot

# Phase 3a: Technology Code of Practice
/arckit.tcop Assess Technology Code of Practice compliance for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot in Private Beta phase

# Phase 3b: AI Playbook
/arckit.ai-playbook Assess AI Playbook compliance for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot using GPT-4 - this is a HIGH-RISK AI system affecting access to benefits

# Phase 3c: ATRS
/arckit.atrs Generate ATRS record for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot using GPT-4, in Private Beta phase, processing citizen questions about benefits eligibility

# Phase 4a: Statement of Work (optional)
/arckit.sow Generate Statement of Work for vendor RFP to build the benefits eligibility chatbot, 9-month timeline, £1.5M budget, procurement via G-Cloud framework

# Phase 4b: Vendor Evaluation (optional)
/arckit.evaluate Create evaluation framework for benefits chatbot vendors

# Phase 5: ServiceNow Service Management (NEW!)
/arckit.servicenow Generate ServiceNow design for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot - Tier 1 HIGH-RISK AI service with 24/7 support

# Phase 6: Quality Analysis
/arckit.analyze

# Phase 7: Traceability
/arckit.traceability Generate traceability matrix from requirements through design to tests
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check all files created
tree projects/

# Check file sizes
wc -l projects/001-benefits-chatbot/*.md

# Check command count
ls -1 .claude/commands/ | wc -l  # Should be 17

# Check template count
ls -1 .arckit/templates/ | wc -l  # Should be 19
```

## What to Look For

### Requirements Quality
- ✅ 50+ requirements across BR, FR, NFR, INT, DR categories
- ✅ Each requirement has acceptance criteria
- ✅ Priorities defined (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- ✅ UK Government compliance built in (GDPR, Equality Act, WCAG)

### UK Government Compliance
- ✅ **TCoP**: All 13 points assessed with score (expect 70-90%)
- ✅ **AI Playbook**: HIGH-RISK determination, mandatory assessments flagged
- ✅ **ATRS**: Complete Tier 1 (public) and Tier 2 (technical) record

### Quality Analysis
- ✅ **Analyze**: Detects real issues (DPIA missing, bias testing incomplete)
- ✅ **Governance health score**: B grade (80-89%) expected
- ✅ **Actionable recommendations**: Specific next steps provided

### Known Expected Issues

The `/arckit.analyze` command **should** detect these issues:

1. ❌ **DPIA not completed** - CRITICAL (blocking for HIGH-RISK AI)
2. ⚠️ **Human-in-the-loop not fully documented** - HIGH
3. ⚠️ **Bias testing methodology incomplete** - HIGH
4. ⚠️ **ATRS not published to GOV.UK** - MEDIUM (required before live)
5. ⚠️ **No HLD/DLD yet** - MEDIUM (design phase not started)

**These are expected** - they demonstrate the analyze command correctly identifies real gaps!
