## I. Strategic Principles

### 1. Cloud-First Architecture

**Principle Statement**:
All new solutions MUST leverage cloud-native services and architectures unless a documented exception is approved by the Cloud Center of Excellence.

**Rationale**:
Cloud platforms provide elasticity, resilience, and operational efficiency that on-premises infrastructure cannot match at our scale and rate of change.

**Implications**:
- Prefer managed services over self-hosted alternatives
- Design for horizontal scalability and distributed systems
- Leverage cloud provider primitives (serverless, managed databases, queues)
- Plan for multi-region deployment from day one

**Approved Providers**:
- **Primary**: [AWS | Azure | GCP]
- **Secondary**: [AWS | Azure | GCP]
- **Prohibited**: On-premises datacenter expansion (except for compliance-mandated scenarios)

**Exceptions**:
- Regulatory requirements mandating on-premises deployment
- Existing systems with <2 years remaining lifecycle
- Edge computing scenarios requiring local processing

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Solution uses cloud-native services
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code defined (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] Multi-region strategy documented
- [ ] Cost model and FinOps tags defined

---

### 2. API-First Integration

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST expose functionality through well-defined, versioned APIs with OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications. Direct database access between domains is prohibited.

**Rationale**:
API-first design enables loose coupling, independent scaling, technology diversity, and clean domain boundaries.

**Implications**:
- Every service exposes RESTful or GraphQL APIs
- OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications required before implementation
- No direct database connections across service boundaries
- Event-driven patterns for asynchronous communication

**Standards**:
- **REST APIs**: OpenAPI 3.0+, JSON payloads, HTTPS only
- **GraphQL**: Federation-ready schemas where applicable
- **Event Streaming**: AsyncAPI 2.0+, CloudEvents format
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant quotas enforced at API gateway

**Exceptions**:
- Legacy system integration during migration period (max 18 months)
- Batch data pipelines (ETL) with documented justification
- Internal admin tools (with security review)

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specification exists
- [ ] API versioning strategy defined
- [ ] Authentication and authorization model documented
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management specified

---

### 3. Security by Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Principle Statement**:
All architectures MUST implement Zero Trust security principles with defense-in-depth. Security is NOT a feature to be added laterâ€”it is a foundational requirement.

**Rationale**:
Our threat landscape requires assuming breach, eliminating implicit trust, and continuously verifying all access requests.

**Zero Trust Pillars**:
1. **Identity-Based Access**: No network-based trust; every request authenticated
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions, time-boxed where possible
3. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256)
4. **Continuous Verification**: Monitor, log, and analyze all access patterns

**Mandatory Controls**:
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all human access
- [ ] Service-to-service authentication (mutual TLS or signed tokens)
- [ ] Secrets management via vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- [ ] Network segmentation with micro-perimeters
- [ ] Encryption at rest for all data stores
- [ ] TLS 1.3+ for all network communication
- [ ] Structured logging of all authentication/authorization events
- [ ] Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

**Compliance Frameworks**:
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 Type II | CIS Controls]
- [GDPR | HIPAA | PCI-DSS | FedRAMP] (if applicable)

**Exceptions**:
- NONE. Security principles are non-negotiable.
- Specific control alternatives may be approved with compensating controls.

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Threat model completed and reviewed
- [ ] Security controls mapped to requirements
- [ ] Penetration test plan defined
- [ ] Incident response runbook created

---

### 4. Observability and Operational Excellence

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST emit structured telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) enabling real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and capacity planning.

**Rationale**:
We cannot operate what we cannot observe. Instrumentation is a first-class architectural requirement.

**Telemetry Standards**:
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs to centralized SIEM/log aggregator
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible exposition, RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation, distributed trace context propagation
- **Alerting**: SLO-based alerting with actionable runbooks

**Required Metrics**:
- Request volume, latency (p50, p95, p99), error rate
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Business metrics (transactions/sec, revenue impact)
- Security events (auth failures, policy violations)

**Log Retention**:
- **Security logs**: 1 year minimum (compliance-driven)
- **Application logs**: 90 days
- **Audit logs**: 7 years (regulatory)

**Exceptions**:
- Prototype/PoC systems (documented as non-production)
- Third-party SaaS where instrumentation is vendor-managed

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Logging, metrics, tracing instrumented
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts configured
- [ ] SLOs/SLIs defined with error budgets
- [ ] Runbooks created for common failure scenarios

1. **Public**: No restrictions (marketing content)
2. **Internal**: Employee-only access (internal docs)
3. **Confidential**: Need-to-know basis (financial data, PII)
4. **Restricted**: Highest controls (PHI, payment cards, trade secrets)

**Data Residency**:
- **GDPR**: EU data subjects' PII stored in EU regions
- **CCPA**: California residents' data access/deletion rights
- **Industry-Specific**: [HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP] requirements

**Data Retention**:
- Automatic deletion after retention period
- Legal hold process for litigation/investigation
- Backup retention aligned with compliance requirements

**Exceptions**:

**Cost Tagging Requirements** (MANDATORY):
- `project`: Project identifier
- `environment`: dev/staging/prod
- `owner`: Team or individual responsible
- `cost-center`: Finance tracking code
- `data-classification`: Security tier

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:
